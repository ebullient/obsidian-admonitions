[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition) | [Changelog](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) | [Issues](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

The Admonitions plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) adds block-styled content and callout functionality to your notes, with a design inspired by [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Development Status: Maintenance Mode**
> Due to a glut of high priority Javalent plugin projects, this plugin is now entering maintenance mode for the time being. This is **not** a permanent status.
> - PRs will be reviewed.
> - Bugs will be reviewed and worked if able.
> - Feature Requests **will not** be worked.

## Features

1. Create either a code block or a callout using Admonitions.
2. If you have Microsoft Document syntax admonitions, Admonitions can auto-convert them to the new callout box syntax with the click of a button.
3. Set default titles, default collapse states, or default no-title options for the callouts you create with Admonitions.
4. Admonitions includes editor suggestions to speed up the process of creating custom admonitions and callout boxes.
5. Admonitions provides helpful commands for inserting callout boxes and the ability to register commands for specific types.
6. Get access to a free FontAwesome Icon library, with options for Opticon and RPG Awesome.
7. Check out the Obsidian TTRPG-Share's [Repository of Admonitions](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/ObsidianTTRPGShare/tree/0a8b23a52fcf6129ddae9fc21a2e7433f83cc343/System-Agnostic/admonitions) for some starter admonitions.

## Quickstart

Admonitions supports two syntaxes. Both use the same type names, and any custom type you define in settings works as either form.

**Callout** (Obsidian's native syntax — simpler, works everywhere):

```md
> [!tip] This is a tip
> This is the content of the admonition.
```

**Code block** (plugin syntax — supports additional parameters):

````md
```ad-tip
title: This is a tip
collapse: open

This is the content of the admonition.
```
````

Code blocks support `title:`, `collapse:`, `icon:`, and `color:` parameters. See [Admonition Options](options.md) for details.
