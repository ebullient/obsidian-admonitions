## Steps

1. Navigate to Obsidian's Settings.
2. Select Admonitions from the Plugin List.
3. Select **Add New** from the first set of options in [Settings](settings.md).
4. In the new window that opens:
   1. Enter an Admonition Type. This will be the name used in code blocks (`` ```ad-type `` ) and callouts (`> [!type]`).
   2. (Optional) Choose a default title shown when no `title:` parameter is given.
   3. Toggle **No Title** mode. When enabled, the admonition renders without a title bar unless you explicitly define `title:` in the code block.
   4. Toggle the copy button. When enabled, a copy action appears in the top-right corner of the admonition content.
   5. Toggle **Style This Admonition with CSS**. When enabled, the plugin skips auto-generating CSS rules for icon and color for this type — icon and color are left entirely to your own CSS snippet.
      - The icon field is ignored. Any icon set here will not be applied.
      - The color picker is disabled; set color in your CSS snippet instead.
      - This is the recommended approach for custom images (PNG, etc.), since image icons only work in codeblock mode, not callout syntax. A CSS snippet using `--callout-icon` works consistently in both.
   6. When **Style with CSS** is off, choose an icon for this admonition type. You can type an icon name or select one from the included icon packs (see [Icon](options.md#icon)).
   7. When **Style with CSS** is off, set a color with the picker.
      - The picker is only active when **Set Admonition Colors** is enabled globally in plugin settings. If that setting is off, color is controlled entirely via CSS for all admonition types.
